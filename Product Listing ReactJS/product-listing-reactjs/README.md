Project Name: Product Listing using ReactJS

This project is a React application that focuses on developing a product listing page. The goal is to leverage React's capabilities to structure the layout, display product cards with mock data, implement basic navigation, and ensure responsiveness for different screen sizes.

Requirements
1. React Project Setup
Start with Create React App or your preferred React setup to initiate the project. This ensures a smooth and standardized development environment.

2. Product Listing Component
Create a dedicated component for the product listing page. This component will serve as the main container for rendering product cards and managing the layout.

3. Product Cards
Render a minimum of 6 product cards within the product listing component. Each card should display mock data including the product name, image, and price. This simulates a real-world product catalog.

4. Navigation
Implement basic routing to enable navigation to a detailed product page when a product card is clicked. This provides a seamless user experience, allowing users to explore individual products in more detail.

5. Responsiveness
Ensure the layout is responsive to different screen sizes. The product listing page should adapt its structure and styling to provide an optimal viewing experience on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

Creating project:

npx create-react-app product-listing-react
cd product-listing-react

Install Dependencies:

npm install
npm install react-router-dom
npm install bootstrap

Run the Development Server:

npm start
This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

Explore the Product Listing Page:
Visit http://localhost:3000 to explore the product listing page. Clicking on a product card should navigate you to a detailed product page.

Project Structure
The project follows a standard React project structure:

src/components/ProductListing.js: Product listing component.
src/components/ProductCard.js: Component for rendering individual product cards.
src/components/ProductDetail.js: Detailed product page component (to be implemented).
src/images: Images used for the project
App.js: Main application component.
index.js: Entry point for the React application.

Future Enhancements

Dynamic Data Loading:
Fetch real product data from an API to enhance the realism of the product listing.

Search and Filtering:
Add search and filtering options to make it easier for users to find specific products.

Sorting Options:
Allow users to sort products based on different criteria such as price, popularity, etc.

Styling Improvements:
Enhance the overall styling of the application for a more polished and professional appearance.
